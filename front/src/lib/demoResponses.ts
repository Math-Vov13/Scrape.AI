  "Hello! I'm a chat assistant. How can I help you today?",
  "That's a great question. Let me provide a detailed answer. The key aspect to consider is that progressive text streaming gives users immediate feedback that their request is being processed, rather than making them wait for the complete response to appear all at once.",
  "I'd be happy to help with that. Streaming text, like you're seeing right now, creates a more engaging conversation experience because it mimics how humans communicate - we don't deliver our thoughts all at once, but rather word by word.",
  "Looking at your code, I can see several ways we could optimize it. First, we should consider the performance implications. Second, let's think about user experience and accessibility. And third, we need to ensure our implementation is maintainable for future developers.",
  "In summary, text streaming creates a more dynamic and interactive feel to conversations with AI assistants. It helps users feel more engaged as they can start processing the response while it's still being generated, rather than waiting for a complete answer to appear all at once."
